# Streamlit-Deploy

This is a project to test the capabilities of Streamlit to host python code. It is quite simple and I am happy with the process. Deployment of the app to streamlit can be done by linking your github to your streamlit account. The setup for autodeploy is done on Streamlit.

Here is the app (app.py) hosted on streamlit: https://beatriceyapsm-streamlit-deploy-app-qmqcef.streamlit.app/

My app takes data with 2 columns "ds" (being the time) and "y" (being any value) and plots it on a graph. Utilizing prophet, I am able to also generate a forecast and plot the outcome on a graph.
